# About me
## In my personal time, some hobbies that I love to do is photography, play soccer, go on walks with my pet dog Oslo, and watch Netflix. I am intrested in expanding my knowlege in computer science hoping to get my degree at NC State. I am a very hard working person, and someone who is commited to learn more.
## Website I Recommend
    - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - I find YouTube as one of my best resources in wanting to learn how to complete a specific task, or somewhere I go when I want to watch something when im eating.
    - [Pinterest](www.pinterest.com) - Pinterest is my favorite go to place as a photographer because almost all of the designs and photo ideas I come up with, are inspired by looking at other's creative work.
